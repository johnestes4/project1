As a user, I want to see the quadrants light up, so I know where to click.

I want the quadrants to light up randomly as I click them, so the game will pose a challenge.

I want the game to know whether I clicked properly, so I can tell if I won or lost.

I want the game to keep track of my score, so I know how well I'm doing.

I want the game to reset when I miss a click, so that I have to try not to lose.
