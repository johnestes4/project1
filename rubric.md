## Project Workflow
Performing -  Great userstories and pseudocode. I know the conceptual model for simon's pretty simple, but wireframes are really helpful for initial prototyping. Great readme.

## Technical Requirements
Excelling - Great job getting the buttons as one click event. Your code is pretty well abstracted and encapsulated. There were only a couple of points of refactoring that I could recommend. Also local storage! hooray! I would love to see the OOP approach you came up with during friday's lab at some point as well! Great work.

## Code Quality
Excelling - One thing I absolutely love is your incredible commenting. Holy crap! Well done. Aside from that, code is well indented and formatted. It also has great encapsulation and abstraction. There was an empty function defintion which was peculiar.

## Creativity Interface
Excelling - I really like the speed feature. And the interface is super clean. I also really like the high scores feature. Great job!

## Overall
Really incredible job john. Expected nothing less. I'd love to see your OOP approach. Looking forward to seeing more of your work!
