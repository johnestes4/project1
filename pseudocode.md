1. start the game when the "begin" button is clicked - set a variable to note that the game is running
2. Initialize two variables that note which turn it is and how many quadrants have lit this turn
3. Use a random number to light as many random quadrants as the turn number - running at 2 second intervals (shorten intervals as turn number increases? Use second variable for that)
4. Store the sequence of quadrants lit in an array
5. When the user clicks a quadrant, store the value of that quadrant in a second array
6. If the array of the quadrant clicked matches the array of the randomly generated one, allow the user to continue. if at any point the arrays don't match up, the user loses and the game ends
